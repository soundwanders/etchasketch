Etch N Sketch Project


notes
// used javascript to generate divs (divs=grid squares here) to fill grid, instead of copy/pasting HTML to creat divs

//grid rows were not generating properly. solved by implementing a default grid height of 75% of the user's screen height and styling grid-template-rows to repeat to the end of the Grid.


//explain problem solving process for grid rows, how i approached and debugged the grid
//explain problem solving process for mouse enter change color
